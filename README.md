# Hang-Man-Python

The game starts by randomly selecting a word from a pre-defined list of words. 
The game then displays the word with all the letters hidden, with only the number of letters visible. 
The user is then prompted to guess a letter.

The game uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user for guesses until the word is fully guessed or the number of allowed guesses is exhausted.

The game also includes an if-else statement to check if the user has run out of guesses or if the word has been fully guessed. 
If the user runs out of guesses, the game will end with a "lose" message. If the user correctly guesses the word, the game will end with a "win" message.

Overall, this simple "Hangman" game uses basic Python programming concepts such as loops, strings, and conditional statements to create a fun and interactive game that allows users to practice their guessing and problem-solving skills.
